# Data Science Portfolio - Jaeyoun "Juniper" Kim
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic and self-learning purposes. This portfolio is a product of the Introductiom to Data Science course from the University of Notre Dame but will be continually updated with relevant projects and works related to my developing skills in data science and visualization.

## Background Information
I am currently a senior at the University of Notre Dame studying Psychology and Global Affairs with a minor in Data Science. My academic and professional interests pertain to understanding people and their needs and improving the institutions that serve them (from a local to global scale). Following graduation, I will be working as a Government Consultant continuing to focus on and develop my skills in serving people and their communities. 

## Goals 
- Data Storytelling: Improve narrative and affective appeal regarding data visualizations and related presentations. 
- Programming: Enhancing current coding competencies and exploring unknown programming languages.
- Machine Learning: Becoming introduced to basic machine learning principles. 
- Data Ethics: Applying new skills with care for its user and working to mitigate data biases. 

## Current Projects
Projects under-construction. More to come soon. Stay tuned. 
- Visitors Sentiment Analysis on University Reviews: Scrape visitor reviews from Google Maps of the top 20 most relevant search results. Apply basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques, or sentiment analysis, and determine basic sentiment of reviews based on prestige of the university. (Programming Language: R) 

## Project Ideas: 
- Overlapping Music Tastes: Based on user's Spotify profile, this data visualization would form venn diagrams illustrating overlapping and distinct artist preferences. Applying such to several users may reveal interesting patterns demonstrating popularity of a particular artist among a group or simply give ideas for what to play in a car full of strangers.
- Fake News Detection: Collect real and fake news headlines and classify them in their respective manner. Use keyword frequency analysis to identify patterns and apply a basic Na√Øve Bayes classifier for predictions.
- Predicting Virality: Use the YouTube API and find trends in views, likes, and comments across different genres. Identify key features of videos that go viral (or receive a noteable amount of views, likes, comments, and other traffic).
- Exploring World Happiness Data: Use the World Happiness Report dataset to compare happiness scores across countries. Find correlations between happiness and factors like GDP, health, and social support and map such through a data visualization that illustrates information and is keeping with the principles of data storytelling.
