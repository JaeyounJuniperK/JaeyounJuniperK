# Data Science Portfolio - Jaeyoun "Juniper" Kim 
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic and self-learning purposes. This portfolio is a product of the Introduction to Data Science course from the University of Notre Dame but will be continually updated with relevant projects and works related to my developing skills in data science and visualization.

## Background Information
I am currently a senior at the University of Notre Dame studying Psychology and Global Affairs with a minor in Data Science. My academic and professional interests pertain to understanding people and their needs and improving the institutions that serve them (from a local to global scale). Following graduation, I will be working as a Government Consultant continuing to focus on and develop my skills in serving people and their communities. 

## Current Projects
- _Palmer's Penguins Streamlit App_: The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Palmer's Penguins dataset, followed by the development of an interactive Streamlit app for data visualization and analysis.
- _Beijing 2008 Olympic Medalist Tidy Data_: The dataset used in this project is the 2008 Beijing Olympics Medalists Dataset. It contains information about athletes, sports categories, gender, and medals awarded. The data underwent cleaning and transformation to ensure compliance with tidy data principles.

- _Supervised Machine Learning App_: This interactive app, built with Streamlit, enables users to explore various machine learning models on different datasets. The app allows users to upload their own dataset or choose from popular sample datasets like Iris (for classification) and Boston (for regression).

-_Unsupervised Machine Learning App_: This interactive app, built with Streamlit, provides a hands-on way to explore unsupervised machine learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The app allows users to upload their own dataset or select from two built-in sample datasets: Iris and Wine.

- _Visitors Sentiment Analysis on University Reviews_: Scrape visitor reviews from Google Maps of the top 20 most relevant search results. Apply basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques, or sentiment analysis, and determine basic sentiment of reviews based on prestige of the university. (Programming Language: R) 

## Future Project Ideas: 
- _Overlapping Music Tastes_: Based on user's Spotify profile, this data visualization would form venn diagrams illustrating overlapping and distinct artist preferences. Applying such to several users may reveal interesting patterns demonstrating popularity of a particular artist among a group or simply give ideas for what to play in a car full of strangers.
- _Fake News Detection_: Collect real and fake news headlines and classify them in their respective manner. Use keyword frequency analysis to identify patterns and apply a basic Naïve Bayes classifier for predictions.
- _Predicting Virality_: Use the YouTube API and find trends in views, likes, and comments across different genres. Identify key features of videos that go viral (or receive a noteable amount of views, likes, comments, and other traffic).
- _Exploring World Happiness Data_: Use the World Happiness Report dataset to compare happiness scores across countries. Find correlations between happiness and factors like GDP, health, and social support and map such through a data visualization that illustrates information and is keeping with the principles of data storytelling. 

## Goals 
- _Data Storytelling_: Improve narrative and affective appeal regarding data visualizations and related presentations. 
- _Programming & Coding_: Enhancing current coding competencies and exploring unknown programming languages.
- _Machine Learning_: Becoming introduced to basic machine learning principles. 
- _Data Ethics_: Applying new skills with care for its user and working to mitigate data biases.
